"""
A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:

        S is empty;
        S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
        S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.

For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.

Write a function:

    def solution(S)

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if string S
is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "(()(())())", the function should return 1 and
given S = "())", the function should return 0, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000];
        string S is made only of the characters "(" and/or ")".
